To use the application following chrome extension is required:
* Moesif cors 
* https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc
* This is due to 'Access Control Allow Origin' header missing in request
* This is a CORS error ( which can be solved with personal backend as well but out of scope )
* used redux template with c-r-a
* used local storage and session storage
